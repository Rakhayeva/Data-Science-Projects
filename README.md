These are study projects completed as part of the Data Science Specialist course at Yandex Practicum, funded by the Shakhmardan Yessenov Science and Education Foundation through a grant I won on a competitive basis. Additionally, I have completed the Mathematics for Data Analysis course at Yandex Practicum. These projects showcase the practical application of data science techniques, including data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling, with real-world datasets.

| Project | Description | Libraries |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| [GoFast User & Revenue Statistical Analysis](Statistic_analysis.ipynb) | This project focuses on analyzing data from the GoFast scooter rental service. Goals: identify key trends, evaluate the effectiveness of the Ultra subscription, study user behavior, and provide recommendations for service improvement. <br><br>**Methods:** Data preprocessing, analysis, hypothesis testing, and revenue calculation. | Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy |
| [Game Success Statistical Analysis](Assembly%20projects.ipynb) | This project analyzes historical game sales, ratings, and genres to identify factors influencing game success. Insights will help "Streamchik" predict successful games and plan marketing for 2017. The goal was to identify key factors affecting game success, including platform, genre, and ratings. <br><br>**Key Tasks:** Data analysis and preprocessing, sales trends by platform/genre, regional user preferences, hypothesis testing, and recommendations for 2017 marketing. <br><br>**Methods:** Data analysis, regression, and hypothesis testing. | Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy |
| [ML for Dairy Farm Optimization](Linear_models_in_machine_learning.ipynb) | This project develops machine learning models to optimize cow selection at the "Volny Lug" dairy farm, ensuring stable milk production and meeting taste quality standards. Two models predict milk yield and assess taste quality. <br><br>**Methods:** Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, correlation analysis, regression modeling, classification modeling. | Matplotlib, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Phik, Scipy, Sklearn |
| [Optimization of Business Decision-Making in Company Workforce Management](hr_decisions_business_oprimization_ml.ipynb) | HR analysts assist the business in optimizing workforce management: the business provides data, and analysts offer solutions to prevent financial losses and employee turnover. <br><br>**Methods:** Build a model to predict employee satisfaction, and another to predict employee turnover. <br><br>**Key Tasks:** Machine learning to enhance decision-making with a focus on data-driven predictions. | Matplotlib, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Shap, Phik, Scipy, Sklearn |
| [Prediction of Used Car Market Prices](gradient_boosting.ipynb) | A used car sales service is developing an app for quick market price estimation based on historical data, including vehicle specifications, configurations, and prices. The goal is to build a machine learning model to predict car prices accurately while ensuring fast predictions and training times. <br><br>**Methods:** Develop and evaluate multiple machine learning models for price prediction, including LightGBM, RandomForestRegressor, and Linear Regression. Models were assessed based on prediction accuracy (RMSE), training time, and prediction speed. <br><br>**Key Tasks:** Data preprocessing: Handle missing values, outliers, and non-informative features <br> Feature engineering: Create a new feature for car age and remove irrelevant features <br> Model training: Train and tune different models using appropriate feature encodings <br> Model evaluation: Analyze RMSE, training time, and prediction time for each model <br> Model selection: Recommend the best-performing model according to business requirements | Matplotlib, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, LightGBM, CatBoost, Sklearn |
