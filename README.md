# Data-Science-Projects

These are the study projects I complete after each module in my "Data Science Specialist" course (Yandex Practicum), which is funded by a grant I won from the Shakhmardan Yessenov Science and Education Foundation. In addition to this course, I am also simultaneously studying "Mathematics for Data Analysis" (Yandex Practicum).
