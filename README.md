These are study projects completed as part of the Data Science Specialist course at Yandex Practicum, funded by the Shakhmardan Yessenov Science and Education Foundation through a grant I won on a competitive basis. Additionally, I have completed the Mathematics for Data Analysis course at Yandex Practicum. These projects showcase the practical application of data science techniques, including data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling, with real-world datasets.
